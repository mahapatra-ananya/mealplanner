# My Personal Project

## Project Proposal

My project is a meal planner. It will allow users to add the meals they plan to
make and/or buy for the week, along with a list of ingredients (for homemade 
meals). There will also be a pantry feature where users can add ingredients 
present in their home. Upon adding the required ingredients for any of the
week's meals, the application will check the pantry and inform the user which
ingredients they need to buy for that week.

This application can be used by anybody who wants to **plan their meals** for the
week or **track their eating habits**. I came up with the idea because I love cooking
and would personally use an application like this to help me organize my meals
and reduce the mental task of having to create a shopping list.

## User Stories

These are the user features I want to incorporate in my application:

- As a user, I want to be able to add a meal to my weekly planner
- As a user, I want to be able to add and delete items from my pantry as I use
them in real life
- As a user, I want to be able to select a meal and see the ingredients 
required to make it
- As a user, I want to be able to view a table of my planned meals grouped 
by day of the week and type of meal (eg - breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- As a user, I want to be able to change the number of columns 
and their titles in my table if I eat more or less than 3 meals a day
- As a user, I want to be able to view an automatically generated shopping
list of ingredients I need for the week but haven't yet bought
